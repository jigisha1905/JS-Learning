# JavaScript: An Overview
JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the foundational technologies of web development, alongside HTML and CSS, and is supported by all major web browsers. Initially designed for client-side scripting, JavaScript has grown into a full-fledged language that powers both front-end and back-end development.
