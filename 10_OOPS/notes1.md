# Javascript and Classes

## OOPS(object oriented programming)
- just syntax
- so that programmers from c++ and java can have large platforms
## objects
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase,date,promises(functions)

## why use OOPS??
- code gets messed up so it can be organized

## parts of OOPS
- object literal
- contructors,protypes
- classes
- instances(new,this keyword)

## 4 pillars of OOPS
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
  
  ## Prototype
  - through this u get classes,access of new keyword
  - prototypal inheritance
