/*
1.js is sychronous(single threaded)
2.execute one line of code at a time(each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing)
3.call stack and memory heap
4.blocking code->block the flow of program(read file sync)
5.Non-blocking code->does not block execution(read file async)

sync->tasks r preformed one after another
async->tasks can be performed concurrently(doesn't have to wait)
